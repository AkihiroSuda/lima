title: VMNet networks
weight: 30
---

VMNet assigns a "real" IP address that is reachable from the host.

The configuration steps are different for each network type:
- [socket\_vmnet](#socket_vmnet)
  - [Managed (192.168.105.0/24)](#managed-192168105024)
  - [Unmanaged](#unmanaged)
- [vzNAT](#vznat)

### socket_vmnet
#### Managed (192.168.105.0/24)

[`socket_vmnet`](https://github.com/lima-vm/socket_vmnet) is required for adding another guest IP that is accessible from the host and other guests.

```bash
# Install socket_vmnet
brew install socket_vmnet

# Set up the sudoers file for launching socket_vmnet from Lima
limactl sudoers >etc_sudoers.d_lima
sudo install -o root etc_sudoers.d_lima /etc/sudoers.d/lima
```

> **Note**
>
> Lima before v0.12 used `vde_vmnet` for managing the networks.
> `vde_vmnet` is still supported but it is deprecated and no longer documented here.

The networks are defined in `$LIMA_HOME/_config/networks.yaml`. If this file doesn't already exist, it will be created with these default
settings:

<details>
<summary>Default</summary>

<p>

```yaml
# Path to socket_vmnet executable. Because socket_vmnet is invoked via sudo it should be
# installed where only root can modify/replace it. This means also none of the
# parent directories should be writable by the user.
#
# The varRun directory also must not be writable by the user because it will
# include the socket_vmnet pid file. Those will be terminated via sudo, so replacing
# the pid file would allow killing of arbitrary privileged processes. varRun
# however MUST be writable by the daemon user.
#
# None of the paths segments may be symlinks, why it has to be /private/var
# instead of /var etc.
paths:
# socketVMNet requires Lima >= 0.12 .
# socketVMNet has precedence over vdeVMNet.
  socketVMNet: /opt/socket_vmnet/bin/socket_vmnet
# vdeSwitch and vdeVMNet are DEPRECATED.
  vdeSwitch: /opt/vde/bin/vde_switch
  vdeVMNet: /opt/vde/bin/vde_vmnet
  varRun: /private/var/run/lima
  sudoers: /private/etc/sudoers.d/lima

group: everyone

networks:
  shared:
    mode: shared
    gateway: 192.168.105.1
    dhcpEnd: 192.168.105.254
    netmask: 255.255.255.0
  bridged:
    mode: bridged
    interface: en0
    # bridged mode doesn't have a gateway; dhcp is managed by outside network
  host:
    mode: host
    gateway: 192.168.106.1
    dhcpEnd: 192.168.106.254
    netmask: 255.255.255.0
```

</p>

</details>

Instances can then reference these networks:

{{< tabpane text=true >}}
{{% tab header="CLI" %}}
```bash
limactl start --network=lima:shared
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="YAML" %}}
```yaml
networks:
  # Lima can manage the socket_vmnet daemon for networks defined in $LIMA_HOME/_config/networks.yaml automatically.
  # The socket_vmnet binary must be installed into a secure location only alterable by the admin.
  # The same applies to vde_switch and vde_vmnet for the deprecated VDE mode.
  # - lima: shared
  #   # MAC address of the instance; lima will pick one based on the instance name,
  #   # so DHCP assigned ip addresses should remain constant over instance restarts.
  #   macAddress: ""
  #   # Interface name, defaults to "lima0", "lima1", etc.
  #   interface: ""
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

The network daemon is started automatically when the first instance referencing them is started,
and will stop automatically once the last instance has stopped. Daemon logs will be stored in the
`$LIMA_HOME/_networks` directory.

The IP address is automatically assigned by macOS's bootpd.
If the IP address is not assigned, try the following commands:
```bash
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/libexec/bootpd
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --unblock /usr/libexec/bootpd
```

#### Unmanaged
```yaml
networks:
  # Lima can also connect to "unmanaged" networks addressed by "socket". This
  # means that the daemons will not be controlled by Lima, but must be started
  # before the instance.  The interface type (host, shared, or bridged) is
  # configured in socket_vmnet and not in lima.
  # - socket: "/var/run/socket_vmnet"
```

### vzNAT

> **Warning**
> "vz" mode is experimental

| âš¡ Requirement | Lima >= 0.14, macOS >= 13.0 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|

For [VZ](./vmtype.md) instances, the "vzNAT" network can be configured as follows:
{{< tabpane text=true >}}
{{% tab header="CLI" %}}
```bash
limactl start --vm-type=vz --network=vzNAT
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="YAML" %}}
```yaml
networks:
- vzNAT: true
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

The range of the IP address is not specifiable.

The "vzNAT" network does not need the `socket_vmnet` binary and the `sudoers` file.
